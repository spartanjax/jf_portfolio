<b>Hey there!</b> Thanks for stopping by :) I'm Jackson, a problem solver at heart with a passion for coding, puzzles, and mathematics. I've recently finished my undergraduate in Computer Science and Mathematics at the University of Auckland, and I'm currently undergoing an internship at Rocket Lab as the Launch Safety Operators Software Intern.

Outside of tech, you'll often find me on the ice, playing hockey - that is, when I'm not injured, of course. Some of my hobbies include gyming, playing chess, poker, and videogames. I really value and try to spend as much quality time with friends and family as possible!
